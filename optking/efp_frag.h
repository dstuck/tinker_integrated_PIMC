/* This class will define a fragment for use in situations where a fragment
is defined by space-fixed coordinates: 3 center-of-mass and 3 Euler angle
coordinates.

This class is intended to be used for fixed-body EFP optimizations in QChem.
In QChem, the gradient is already computed in these space-fixed coordinates.
Thus, it is not necessary to write the code for the B-matrix to do an
optimization.  Eventually, a B-matrix will be necessary in order to, for
example, transform a cartesian analytic Hessian into internal coordinates for
these optimizations.

Since the angular coodinates are be described as linear combinations of positions of
atoms, a new type of B-matrix will be necessary.  We might be able to use
the principle axes to define the coordinates (derived by WDA), but we would
still have to relate these to the space-fixed coordinates of the gradient
computed by QChem.
