                 FFTW -- Fast, Parallel FFT for OpenMP TINKER
                 --------------------------------------------

      This directory contains FFTW-3.3 which is required by the OpenMP
      version of TINKER. In particular, TINKER needs the two fftw static
      object libraries, libfftw3.a and libfftw3_omp.a. To build fftw
      using the Intel compilers, issue the following set of commands as
      shown below. Note that the 'setenv" syntax is for csh/tcsh shells,
      and should be modified for other shells. Also. the --prefix in the
      "configure" command should be changed to the correct path on your
      local machine (ie, the current /fftw area under the TINKER tree).

      setenv CC gcc          (or use "export CC=gcc" for bash)
      setenv F77 gfortran    (or use "export F77=gfortran" for bash)
      make distclean
      configure --prefix=/Users/ponder/tinker/fftw --enable-openmp
      make
      make install

      The above "setenv" commands are for use of the GNU compilers. To
      use the Intel or PGI compilers, substitute "icc" or "pgcc" for
      "gcc", and "ifort" or "pgf95" for "gfortran".

      After completion of the above commands, the libraries files used
      by TINKER will be in the /lib subdirectory.

      Note modified versions of the configure script are used to enforce
      processor-specific compiler flags. In particular, there are macosx
      and linux versions for the Intel compiler that use  -axssse3 and
      -axsse3, respectively, along with other optimization flags. The
      original file is available as "configure-orig".
